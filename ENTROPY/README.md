### Here we showcase how the self-optimizer can be put to use for 'high entropy' states.
These states are comprised of multiple elements, and thus their composition, size, stoichiometry all together multiply the state space.
To explore spaces like this automatically, we employ the self-optimizer with minimal adjustment.
This time the neural networks are encoded with SchentPack (https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack)

The genetic algorithm is encoded with atomic simulations environment, as is the database archetecture (https://gitlab.com/ase/ase)
