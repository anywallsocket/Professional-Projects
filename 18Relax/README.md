Here we showcase how the Active Learning algorithm relaxes 18 atom AuPd clusters through their global configuration space.
That is, starting from essentially arbitrary positions within the unit cell, the clusters eventually find their global minima.
These plots show the density of atomic positions -- or 'likelihood of location'.

The general trend is that eventually the center gets occupied most often, with a shell around it and a gap between.
This is because whereas initially intermediate locations were likely, since atoms were distributed,
at later iterations the cluster is packed, and layering becomes necessary.
